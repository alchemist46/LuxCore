# Known bugs

Bugs and issues found during a task that were not fixed right away. See "Keep the bug list" in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the rules. Remove an entry when it is fixed.

The first entries were collected on 2026-10-20 from "Known open issues" in [MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md](docs/history/MODERNIZATION_PLAN.md) (the "Found" date is the date given there) and from [SPEEDUP_CHANGES.md](docs/history/SPEEDUP_CHANGES.md); the plan has the full measurements. Entries the plan already marks as fixed are not listed. The open work items are in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Bugs in the BlendLuxCore addon are in the addon's own `BUGS.md`.

### Render-thread segfaults when many tests run in one process
- Found: 2026-10-13
- Area: engine, tests
- Problem: SIGSEGV or SIGBUS in a CPU render thread in the middle of a render, roughly once every 20-160 tests (every 20-90 with `--filter OCL`). Each crashed test passes when re-run alone.
- Reproduce: `pyunittests/unittests.py --filter OCL` on the HIP device; `--filter HaltEdit` (PATHCPU, 12 threads, RANDOM sampler, `simple` scene) crashed in 2 of 3 runs. Single `*_PATHOCL_METROPOLIS` tests on the HIP device (`GlassMaterial`, `ImageMapTexture`) crash on their own.
- Notes: the frames look overwritten (float-like values in saved pointers). Not a stop-time use-after-free. With `opencl.native.threads.count = 0` 0 of 10 runs crashed, so the suspect is the native CPU threads that PATHOCL runs beside the GPU (Metropolis sampler); the GPU kernels are not involved. A `-fstack-protector-all` build passed 8 runs. `HaltEdit_Threshold` re-creates the `FilmConvTest` in `Film::Parse()` while the threads render: no race with the render threads found by reading (2026-10-22). Next step: a LuxCore-only ASan build (MSVC has `/fsanitize=address` on Windows) (needs `libasan`/`libubsan` on the development machine).

### PATHOCL halt bias with the subsurface material
- Found: 2026-10-18
- Area: engine (PATHOCL)
- Problem: a subsurface walk takes one iteration per step, so the long walks (the darker ones) are the paths in flight at the halt, and a subsurface sphere reads up to 1.8% too bright at 64 spp (0.2% at 512).
- Reproduce: subsurface sphere, PATHOCL, `batch.haltspp = 64`.
- Notes: the general halt bias (paths in flight) was fixed on 2026-10-18; this is the opposite effect of the subsurface walks.

### Dense scattering media behind a delta glass read wrong in the furnace
- Found: 2026-10-18 (the sigma_s 1 loss, fixed 2026-10-21); this part 2026-10-21
- Area: material, engine (volumes)
- Problem: white furnace, a unit sphere with a white homogeneous interior (`multiscattering = 1`) behind a delta `glass` (kr = kt = 1, ior 1.5): at sigma_s 4 PATHCPU reads 1.11-1.16 and PATHOCL 0.91 (1024 spp, relative std 1.6-2.9 per pixel: fireflies). At sigma_s 1 both read 0.996-0.999 and the `null` boundary is lossless at both densities. The rough OpenPBR glass read 0.894 at sigma_s 4 (0.910 with roughness 0) before the fix: not re-measured. BIDIRCPU reads 1.059 at sigma_s 1 and 1.145 at sigma_s 4 (2026-10-22, 256 spp).
- Reproduce: `tests/furnace/furnace.py PATHCPU glass-vol-s4 spp=1024` (and PATHOCL).
- Notes: the sigma_s 1 loss (0.630) was the correlation of the volume's scatter decision with the glass lobe choice (both read the same pass-through event), fixed by remapping the event for the surface. The CPU and GPU disagree at sigma_s 4 in opposite directions, so it is not a shared estimator bias; the fireflies come from long internal paths with the lobe probability clamped to [0.25, 0.75].

### BiDir reads 2-4% low on rough glass
- Found: 2026-10-18
- Area: engine (BIDIRCPU), material
- Problem: BiDir is 2-4% low on rough glass and on the OpenPBR glass alike (OpenPBR 0.990/0.973/0.966 at alpha 0.2/0.5/1, half glass over a white base 0.955). The path engines read 0.997/0.992 at alpha 0.5/1.
- Reproduce: white furnace with a rough glass sphere, BIDIRCPU against PATHCPU.
- Notes: not the interface's compensation. The `fromLight` branches of `Sample()` have not been derived against the adjoint BSDF. Leaving the Russian roulette out of the MIS weights (2026-10-22) did not change it: 0.969/0.974/0.961 for rough glass, OpenPBR glass and half glass at alpha 0.5 (256 spp).

### Caustics seen through a specular surface are missing with light tracing
- Found: 2026-10-16
- Area: engine (light tracing)
- Problem: a floor caustic reflected in a mirror or seen through a window is produced by neither side: the eye path drops it as caustic and the light tracer connects only directly to the lens. Missing energy with light tracing on, unless PhotonGI's caustic cache is on too.
- Reproduce: caustic on a floor, seen in a mirror, with `path.hybridbackforward.enable`.
- Notes: MNEE covers part of it; the rest is a bidirectional connection, out of scope for the hybrid. On PATHCPU the hybrid on and off agree on a floor caustic seen in a mirror and through a window (2026-10-22, 512 spp), so it is not reproduced there; PATHOCL not checked yet (the GPU was down).

### Direct light sampling is off for emissive meshes above 256 triangles
- Found: 2026-10-16
- Area: light
- Problem: `emission.directlightsampling.type = AUTO` (the default) disables direct light sampling for emissive meshes with more than 256 triangles; they are found by BSDF rays only (noisy). The classroom's lamp meshes are such lights.
- Reproduce: classroom scene.
- Notes: the light tree keeps the limit (measured 2026-10-16): lifting it lets decorative lamp meshes take the picks of the real lights next to them.

### GPU Metropolis sampler bias with short chains
- Found: 2026-10-17
- Area: engine (PATHOCL)
- Problem: each task estimates the mean image luminance (the Kelemen normalization) from its own large steps, and each chain starts at a uniform sample, not at one drawn proportionally to the luminance. Both bias short chains in opposite directions (simple scene, 150x100, one task per pixel, at the test halt: +0.9%; with a fixed exact luminance and 512K tasks the start-up alone is -20% at 267 spp).
- Reproduce: `*_PATHOCL_METROPOLIS` tests; small films or few spp.
- Notes: a global luminance estimate (a reduction over the tasks) and a resampled start (PSSMLT bootstrap) would remove both. Only matters when the chains are short.

### BiDir darkens the silhouette of the furnace sphere
- Found: 2026-10-22
- Area: engine (BIDIRCPU)
- Problem: in the white furnace the pixels on the outline of the sphere read 0.6-0.7 with BIDIRCPU, whatever the material (matte too), and the image mean is 0.973 against 0.9999 with PATHCPU; the inner disk is right (0.999). The "mu < .2" band of `tests/furnace/furnace.py` shows it (0.40 for matte).
- Reproduce: a white matte sphere under a constant white environment, orthographic camera, 48x48, no pixel filter, BIDIRCPU 512 spp: the first and the last pixel on the sphere of the centre row and column read 0.6.
- Notes: in the build before the camera row fix (b22905df5) the dark ring was one row off (row 0 on top, the third last row at the bottom); now it is symmetric. Suspects: the light-traced connections to the camera at grazing angles. Not investigated.

### TILEPATHOCL is slow with dense, nearly white subsurface media
- Found: 2026-10-22
- Area: engine (TILEPATHOCL)
- Problem: a random walk goes on past 256 bounces with a Russian roulette, up to 65536 (`subsurface_funcs.cl`), and TILEPATHOCL runs the trace and `MK_RT` kernels of a tile pass until its last task is done, one walk step per iteration (about 0.37 ms each with 4096 tasks, launch-bound): the longest walk of the pass sets its time. Measured 2026-10-22 (furnace, 96x96, 256 spp, TILEPATHOCL against the old hard limit of 256 bounces): a white sphere of mean free path 0.01 of its radius takes 24 s instead of 1 s (it read 0.864 with the limit, 0.997 now), mean free path 1.0 6 s instead of 1 s, albedo 0.95 10 s instead of 1 s (0.922 with the limit, 0.962 now). Albedo 0.8 and below, and the coloured and coated cases, take the same time. PATHOCL is barely affected (4 s for the densest), since its tasks start new samples independently.
- Reproduce: `tests/furnace/furnace.py TILEPATHOCL subsurface-rad0.01 spp=256` against `PATHOCL`.
- Notes: the energy the limit lost is real (4% at albedo 0.95), so the fix is to take several walk steps per kernel launch rather than to shorten the walks: that needs the ray traversal inside `MK_RT` (HIPRT can traverse from any kernel) instead of the separate trace kernel. A TILEPATHOCL-only steeper roulette (survival (b / (b + 1))^2, reaching n bounces with (256 / n)^2) would shorten the tail at the cost of noise in the densest media; not tried.
### One pixel of luxball-hdr-vol differs between TILEPATHOCL runs at a fixed seed
- Found: 2026-10-22
- Area: engine
- Problem: two runs of the same build should differ by at most 1e-6 per value (the atomic adds of the film), but pixel (x 143, y 101) of luxball-hdr-vol comes out with one of two values that differ by 1.5e-2 (relative); the rest of the image is identical.
- Reproduce: `tests/benchmark/parity.py render <dir> luxball-hdr-vol` (TILEPATHOCL, seed 1, aa 8, 320x240, HIP device) six times with the same build, then `compare`: 2 of 6 runs at HEAD `aa2fa98c1` had the other value.
- Notes: always the same pixel and the same two values, so one sample takes one of two discrete outcomes depending on timing, not accumulation order. Suspects: something read across tasks or threads in the volume path (the null-shell boundary init of V4, the pass-through of V1, the ray-hit buffers of the volume continuation). It can make a bit-identical check of `parity.py` fail on this scene: re-run it before looking for a change.

### PATHOCL renders the sun 0.1% brighter than PATHCPU
- Found: 2026-10-22
- Area: light (sun), engine (PATHOCL)
- Problem: a grey matte sphere and floor lit only by a sun read 1.0011 of PATHCPU in every channel with PATHOCL (2 seeds each, 256 spp, 96x96; the seed noise is under 1e-4). The other lights of the same check (sky2, a point light and an emissive quad with a temperature, a constant environment) agree within 0.02%.
- Reproduce: `tests/benchmark/cpugpu.py <outdir> cases=sun` (a `sun` light, `dir = 0.3 -0.4 1`, gain 0.01, path depth 8).
- Notes: not investigated. Suspects: the sun disk sampling or its pdf (cone angle from the relative size), CPU against GPU.
